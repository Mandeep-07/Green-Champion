Smart Municipal Solid Waste Management Portal
A digital-first, community-driven ecosystem to solve India’s municipal solid waste (MSW) challenges. This platform integrates citizen training, decentralized monitoring, incentive systems, facility tracking, and enforcement workflows—creating a strict, transparent, and scalable solution aligned with CPCB and MoHUA guidelines.


🌍 Background
India generates nearly 1.7 lakh tonnes of solid waste daily (FY 2021–22). Of this, only 54% is scientifically treated while the rest leaks into open dumping, drains, and water bodies—leading to environmental and health hazards. (CEEW, 2025)

Key statistics:
🟡1,70,339 TPD generated; 1,56,449 TPD collected.
🟡91,511 TPD treated; 41,455 TPD landfilled.
🟡Waste-to-energy and biogas infrastructure exists but is underutilized due to poor segregation, compliance, and monitoring.

Our platform addresses this gap with training, accountability, and digital monitoring at every stage of the waste chain.


🚀 Project Overview
This system ensures:
🟢Every citizen is trained and certified in waste management.
🟢Every waste worker receives safety training and monitoring support.
🟢Every household is equipped with dustbins and compost kits.
🟢Every ULB/GP is digitally monitored with decentralized dashboards.
🟢Every facility (recycling, composting, W-to-E) is mapped, tracked, and connected.


✨ Essential Features
🟢User-Friendly Interface
Role-based responsive UI for citizens, waste workers, and area committees (“Green Champions”).

🟢Mandatory Training Modules
Interactive e-learning with quizzes, certifications, and progress dashboards.

🟢Dustbin & Kit Distribution Tracking
Digital tracking of 3-bin distribution and compost kits with automated reminders.

🟢Geo-Tagged Incident Reporting
Citizens upload photos of illegal dumping, escalated to Green Champions for action.

🟢Incentives & Leaderboards
Reward programs, badges, and compliance-based recognition for bulk waste generators and households.

🟢Penalization & Exception Logging
Automated fine issuance and restriction workflows for non-compliant sites.

🟢Digital Waste Facility Locator
Interactive maps of biomethanization plants, W-to-E plants, recycling centers, and scrap shops.

🟢Waste Vehicle Tracking
GPS-based live monitoring, route optimization, and historical audit logs.

🟢E-Commerce for Utilities
Buy dustbins, compost kits, and other essentials directly via the platform.

🟢Decentralized Dashboards
Local committees and ULBs track compliance, incidents, and resource allocation.

🟢Multi-Language Support
Inclusive participation across diverse Indian demographics.


🔄 Workflow

1.Registration & Onboarding
Citizens and workers register via OTP; onboarding directs them to role-specific utilities.

2.Training & Certification
Interactive training → assessment → certification → status logged for authorities.

3.Utility Distribution
Dustbins and compost kits digitally tracked; reminders for unused kits.

4.Incident Reporting
Citizens upload geo-tagged photos; Green Champions validate and resolve issues.

5.Compliance & Monitoring
Scheduled digital logging of collection and segregation; non-compliance triggers penalties.

6.Incentive & Engagement
Gamified dashboards with leaderboards, points, and community challenges.

7.Waste Movement & Facility Mapping
GPS tracking + interactive maps showing recycling options.

8.Administrative Backends
Green Champions and ULBs access analytics, facility dashboards, and audit logs.
